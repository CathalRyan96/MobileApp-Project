## Mobile Application Project

For my project for the Mobile Application Development 2 module , I decided to create an app that allows the user to keep track of the score at GAA games. More directed to GAA games that do not have a scoreboard present.

## Project Specification

The UWP application should be well designed with a clear purpose in mind. Answer the question
“why will the user open this app for a second time?” as part of the design process. What makes your
app better than the others available offering the same function?
The application can be a game (UNITY is acceptable with C# scripting) or an interactive information
app. What the app does is up to you. You can have a single page app, or one with many pages – that
is a choice.

## Requirements

Well-designed UI that is fit for purpose and provides a good user experience.
• Uses local/roaming storage for storing data and/or settings that are necessary for or
enhance this user experience.
• Demonstrates appropriate use of the sensors/hardware available on UWP capable devices
o Accelerometer, gyroscope, location services, sound, network service (connect to
server for data), camera, multi touch gestures
• The app must be more than a simple information app. It must have interactivity as part of
the design.

This application was developed  using visual studio 2017 community and was written in C# and XAML.

## Windows Store

This app is currently going through the certification stages of being published to the store.
It has passed the Windows App Certification Kit Test.
I have a folder on this repository(certification-progress) containing screenshots of the apps progress on being published to the store.
I will update this section of the README when the app has been accepted to the store
