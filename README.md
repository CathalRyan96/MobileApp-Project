## Mobile Application Project

For my project for the Mobile Application Development 2 module , I decided to create an app that allows the user to keep track of the score at GAA games. More directed to GAA games that do not have a scoreboard present.

## Project Specification

The UWP application should be well designed with a clear purpose in mind. Answer the question
“why will the user open this app for a second time?” as part of the design process. What makes your
app better than the others available offering the same function?
The application can be a game (UNITY is acceptable with C# scripting) or an interactive information
app. What the app does is up to you. You can have a single page app, or one with many pages – that
is a choice.

## Requirements

Well-designed UI that is fit for purpose and provides a good user experience.
• Uses local/roaming storage for storing data and/or settings that are necessary for or
enhance this user experience.
• Demonstrates appropriate use of the sensors/hardware available on UWP capable devices
o Accelerometer, gyroscope, location services, sound, network service (connect to
server for data), camera, multi touch gestures
• The app must be more than a simple information app. It must have interactivity as part of
the design.

## User Guide 

- Click start button on the main page.
- Enter names of both teams involved in the game.
- Click the start button to start the time.
- Enter in the scores as the game goes on by clicking the +1 and -1 buttons.


## Architecture

This application was developed  using visual studio 2017 community and was written in C# and XAML.

## C Sharp

C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications that run on the .NET Framework. You can use C# to create Windows client applications, XML Web services, distributed components, client-server applications, database applications, and much, much more. Visual C# provides an advanced code editor, convenient user interface designers, integrated debugger, and many other tools to make it easier to develop applications based on the C# language and the .NET Framework.

## Windows Store

The app is now availible on the store and can be found at this link:
